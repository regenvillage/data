​Agenda:

​9AM: Doors Open, Breakfast Served

​9:30AM: Panel Starts

​Post Panel: Networking

​This discussion sits at the intersection between blockchain and open source. Our panelists will look at how the existing and upcoming regulatory frameworks affect the creation and use of blockchain solutions built on open-source software. Additionally, we will discuss how regulations such as the Data Act, Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, the Cyber Resilience Act and Product Liability Directive impact open-source solution development, the open-source community, and the future of blockchain innovation. We will also look at the challenges and opportunities in this area, offering practical advice for developers and companies to grow and stay compliant.

​This event is brought to you by JUST Open Source Stiftung, YPOG, The Blockchain Lawyers Forum, and EUCI (European Crypto Initiative), and World of Women.
